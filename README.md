# Employee SQL Analysis (proof of concept)

## Project background

This project is a proof of concept for database design, ETL, and data analysis tasks. (Fictional) staff data stored in CSVs were loaded to PostgreSQL tables, based upon a custom-designed database schema. 

## What's in this repo
* A Jupyter notebook that uses SQLAlchemy, pandas, and Matplotlib to load the data into PostgreSQL and perform basic analysis tasks.
* The EmployeeSQL directory contains the database ERD, schemata, and queries to explore and connect the data.
